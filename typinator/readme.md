# My Typinator Sets
I wrote about how I use [Typinator](http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/) and [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) together to automate writing in an article you can read [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/write-once-never-write-again-c2fa1f6c4e8).

Here you can find the different Sets that I use from Typinator to speed up my writing.

The Sets can be found in [this folder](./sets) and here is their explanation. I activate nearly all the snippets from Typinator quick search and thus most snippets won't have any kind of trigger.

1. Word expand - Single word expansions of words with more than 5-6 characters.
2. Fantastical - Expansions for easing entering of natural input in [Fantastical app](https://flexibits.com/fantastical).
	- More information on this Set can be found in [this article](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr).
3. Corrections - Simple corrections like expanding 'eg ' to 'e.g.'.
4. Dates - Expanding current date in different formats like DD/MM/YYYY.
5. Questions - Common questions I found myself asking.
6. Phrases - Common phrases I found myself saying.
7. Sentences - Common sentences I found myself saying.
8. Markdown - Quick expansions of badges and other things.
9. VS Code - Currently only holds `alfred build` task template. For code, I use VS Code snippet engine itself.
10. KM - Quickly type and complete Keyboard Maestro variables.
11. HTML - Common HTML snippets.
