# Night blue theme for Textual IRC client
I usually split [Textual](https://www.codeux.com) and [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) client in full screen side by side. And Telegram has a pretty awesome Night blue theme I use and like.

I changed [TotalSublime](https://github.com/danieldbird/total-sublime) theme colours to match the Night Blue look of Telegram.

Here is how it looks side by side:

## Install
To install the theme, download the Night Blue folder attached [here](Night%20blue).

Then go to Textual app. Go to preferences and in Styles click on `Browse Styles` here:

Put the downloaded folder inside the folder. You can read [this](https://help.codeux.com/textual/Styles.kb) for more information.
