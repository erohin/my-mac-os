# [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net)
You can read about how I use the app in a lot of detail in [my wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/BetterTouchTool.html).

Here you can find the [PDF file](./gestures.pdf) with all the custom gestures I have made together with a [downloadable .JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/master/btt/Main.json) that you can import to your BetterTouchTool to get all gestures I setup for myself.
